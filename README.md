# Foodease

This is the frontend repository of my bootcamp capstone project; Foodease. Ever had ingredients in your kitchen but not sure what to cook? Or gone shopping to prepare a meal and forgot to buy one or two of the ingredients? Foodease solves these problems while reducing food waste. Foodease is a web app that allows users to:

- Take pictures of ingredients they have at home, upload them and get recipes to cook! Users can do this using the `GetRecipes` feature.
- Type a meal they want to prepare and get a shopping list for that meal. Users can do this using the `GetShoppingLiist` feature.

Foodease reduces food waste by:

- Allowing users use leftover ingredients which might have gone waste; and
- Letting users buy only what they need by giving them the exact quatities to buy in their shopping list. (In future, the app will let users select the number of servings for the meal they want to cook, and the shopping list will match that quantity per serving).

This app is built using react framework.
